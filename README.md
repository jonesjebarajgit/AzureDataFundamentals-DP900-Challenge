# Azure Data Fundamentals - COVID 19 Challenge

## Introduction

This Challenge is designed so that the students will construct a fully functional Modern Data Platform utilizing COVID-19 data and help derive analytical insights.  The process of collecting, organizing and making inferences based on different data sources is someting that most data practioners need to do at some point in there career.  This challenge teaches how to do this in Azure.  

## Introduction

The goal of this challenge is to give students with hands-on experience of working with Azure Data Services. This challenge is broadly classified into 3 main sections: 

1) Initial Setup 
2) Building Enterprise data estate 
3) Derive Insights

**Note:  This lab is recommended to be done over at least three days.  Is it very in-depth and will test most students.**

## Learning Objectives

In this challenge you will be preparing, collecting, cleaning, correlating and examining available data sets. 

The technical learning objectives:

1. Provision a Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, and Synapse Analytics
2. Load data into Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB from the given dacpac and CSV file in this repo.
3. Land data in the Synapse SQL Pool from Cloud resources (Azure SQL and CosmosDB).
4. Create Data Pipelines to merge the datasets into usuable format.
5. Execute queries to extract Analytical insights.
